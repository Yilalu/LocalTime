        <p>The Ethiopian calendar is a solar calendar that is based on the Julian calendar, with a few
        modifications. In the Ethiopian calendar, each year has 365 days, with an additional day 
        added to leap years, which occur every four years. The leap year in the Ethiopian calendar 
        is called a "Pagume" year, and it consists of an additional month of five or six days 
        that is added after the 13th month.</p>

        <p>The Ethiopian calendar has a unique way of counting time. The day starts at sunrise, which 
          is usually around 6:00 AM. The first hour of the day is 1:00 AM, the second hour is 2:00 AM, 
          and so on until the 12th hour, which is 12:00 PM. After the 12th hour, the counting starts 
          again, so the first hour of the afternoon is 1:00 PM, the second hour is 2:00 PM, and so on 
          until the 12th hour, which is midnight.</p>
        
        <p>In addition to the unique way of counting time, the Ethiopian calendar has its own system 
          for calculating dates. The Ethiopian year starts on September 11th in the Gregorian calendar, 
          which is also the first day of the Ethiopian month of Meskerem. The Ethiopian calendar is 
          approximately 7.5 years behind the Gregorian calendar.</p>
