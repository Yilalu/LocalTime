# EthiopianLocaLtIM
While browsing the web, I found it increasingly difficult to accurately track the local time in Ethiopia. The available time displayed held little relevance for me, and it quickly became evident that a solution was needed. This realization sparked the beginning of an enlightening journey, leading me to develop a script designed to accurately track Ethiopian time. This endeavor not only enriched my technical prowess but also gave me a unique cultural insight into the Geez language.

Initially, my ambition was simple: create a basic time counter using the core building blocks of web development - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I started by structuring the webpage with HTML, defining the contents and layout. Here, I introduced elements that would display the time, meticulously organized to enhance the user's viewing experience.

Next, I employed CSS to breathe life into the webpage, imbuing it with style and visual appeal. Colors, spacing, and font were all carefully chosen to create a pleasing aesthetic. The key, I found, was to strike a balance between utility and design. The webpage had to be visually appealing, yet the display should not overshadow the primary function of providing accurate Ethiopian time.

The beating heart of this project was JavaScript. JavaScript allowed me to control the dynamic aspects of the webpage and was integral to developing the time counter. By leveraging built-in methods and date objects, I was able to constantly fetch and update the Ethiopian time on the webpage.

However, as I delved deeper into this project, I decided to make a shift. I aimed to display the counter in the Geez language, one of Ethiopia's most historically significant languages. The challenge here was not only to adopt a new linguistic system but also to represent this system digitally. The choice to display numbers in the Geez language added a layer of complexity to the project, yet it also made it profoundly personal and culturally rich.

To address this, I leveraged UNICODE, a universal character encoding standard. UNICODE has been instrumental in ensuring the accurate representation and compatibility of text in various languages across different systems and platforms. It offered a unique opportunity to convert English numbers into Geez numbers. Through careful implementation and meticulous coding, I incorporated this feature into the JavaScript, ensuring seamless conversion and accurate display of the Geez numerals.

Looking back, the journey from a simple time tracker to a culturally embedded Ethiopian time counter was filled with challenges and insights. Not only did I get to refine my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I also delved into the cultural significance of the Geez language and the technicalities of UNICODE. This journey has shown me that web development isn't just about creating functional websites; it's about how we can incorporate cultural and historical elements to create something that is technologically sophisticated and culturally meaningful. In the end, the Ethiopian time counter I developed is not just a testament to my technical skills, but also a tribute to the richness of Ethiopian culture.
