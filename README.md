# EthiopianLocaLtIM
When I was looking for Ethiopian local time on the website I coud not able to get.
It was irrelevant for me the time I get, then I start to write this script to make sure I can have
right time track of Ethiopia. 

Intially, my intention was to develop just a time counter, but after I start working I chnaged my mind to make the counter in Geez language
Finally, I made it.
